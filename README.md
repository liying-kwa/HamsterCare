SUTD 50.001 Introduction to Information Systems: 1D Android Code

## Abstract
In 2011, SPCA reported a 10% rise in pet neglect cases from the year before, Furthermore, it was noted that at least 70% of the 1027 reported cases of animal cruelty involved pet neglect, likely due to the ownersâ€™ busy lifestyles and lack of commitment towards taking care of the pet. Despite the high investment of time and effort in taking care of a pet, people are still interested in owning one because of the various benefits they provide, such as stress-relief and companionship.

We address this pressing issue by providing pet owners with a convenient pet-care product that allows users to remotely care for their pet. Through the product and its corresponding mobile application, users can remotely top-up food and water, as well as take a picture of their pet to check its wellbeing. Automatic topping-up of food and water can also be enabled for convenience, and the product comes with a built-in safety feature that ensures the top-up of either food and water following the lack of action towards an empty food or water notification.

## Introduction
This is the accompanying mobile application to our automated smart pet-care system. The app provides a friendly interface for users to monitor their pet's food and water levels, as well as the pet itself. More information can be found in the Help Tab located within the menu bar at the top right hand corner.

## Usage
Just download, open in Android Studio or your preferred IDE, and build and run on your phone.
